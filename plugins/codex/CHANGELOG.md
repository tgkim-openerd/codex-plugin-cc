# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- `task --resume-id <thread-id>` — resume a specific Codex thread by app-server id, mutually exclusive with `--resume-last` / `--fresh` (#230)
- `task --context <text>` — prepend a `<context>...</context>` block before the user prompt for cheap orientation (#284)
- `task --fast` — request the Codex fast service tier (~1.5x speed / ~2x credits) via `-c service_tier=fast`. Forces direct codex spawn (broker bypass) so a fast caller does not change tier for non-fast siblings (#210)
- `review --branch <ref>` / `adversarial-review --branch <ref>` — review a remote branch without local checkout. Default base is the repo default branch; pair with `--base` for explicit ranges (#114)

## 2.0.0 — BREAKING

- **BREAKING**: plugin codex sessions now land in `$HOME/.codex/claude-code/` (`CODEX_HOME` override) instead of polluting `~/.codex/` and the Codex Desktop history feed. Restore legacy shared home with `CODEX_PLUGIN_USE_DEFAULT_HOME=1` (#282)
- **BREAKING**: sandbox default is inherited from `~/.codex/config.toml` (`sandbox_mode`) instead of hard-coded `read-only` / `workspace-write`. Linux bwrap failures, macOS Seatbelt `.git` blocks, and `--write + git push` DNS failures are gone. Restore legacy with `CODEX_PLUGIN_SANDBOX_DEFAULT=read-only` (#240 / #167 / #304)
- one-shot first-run notice on stderr documents both BREAKING changes + the opt-out env vars. Suppress with `CODEX_PLUGIN_SUPPRESS_V2_NOTICE=1`
- `task --full-access` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — convenience aliases that imply `--sandbox danger-full-access --approval never`. Explicit `--sandbox` / `--approval` still win. Prints a stderr warning when active (#124 / #145)
- `task --prompt-stdin` — explicit pipe marker for multi-KB prompts that would otherwise trip the upstream argv-size rejection that masquerades as "user denied" (#308). One-shot stderr warning when an inline prompt exceeds 3 KB
- `review --max-findings <N>` — lift the implicit 2-3 finding cap (default 20, hard cap 100). prompts/adversarial-review.md updated to instruct the model accordingly (#298)
- `review --background` is finally wired through `enqueueBackgroundTask` (it had been declared in options but never read) (#279 / #207)
- stop-review-gate hook: rate-limit / quota / timeout / invalid-JSON / empty-output all return `decision: "allow"` with a stderr warning instead of a `decision: "block"` rewake loop that burned CC session tokens on every retry (#306 / #248 / #273)

## 1.0.6

- Windows + Git Bash / MSYS2: hook commands `cd "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"` first so node receives a relative script path that resolves on every drive. MODULE_NOT_FOUND on cross-drive setups is gone (#285)
- review prompt: when the workspace is a linked git worktree, surface that fact in the collection-guidance block so Codex stops probing `--git-dir` / `safe.directory` for ~10 sandbox-declined commands (#280)
- `task --profile <name>` — select a `[profiles.<name>]` block from `~/.codex/config.toml` for the invocation. Forces a direct codex spawn so the broker's fixed profile does not override (#251)
- `clientInfo.name` reports `codex-plugin-cc` instead of `Claude Code`. gpt-5.5 no longer rejects with 400 `invalid_request_error` from the upstream allow-list (#199 / #276)
- delegated session thread name now includes the jobId when the user did not pass a prompt (fall-back path), so /codex:status + Codex Desktop can tell repeated "continue" sessions apart (#283)
- review structured-output path: when the user's default model is `gpt-5.5` and the upstream still rejects it for structured review, auto-fallback to `gpt-5.4` once with a warning. Explicit `--model` is always honored (#270)
- custom `openai_base_url` in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `CODEX_PLUGIN_SKIP_AUTH=1`) bypasses the OpenAI auth gate. Self-hosted endpoints and proxies work without patching plugin source (#233)
- stale-auth-cache failure path is annotated with a clear "restart Claude Code so the next invocation re-reads ~/.codex/auth.json" hint after `codex logout && codex login` (#281)

## 1.0.5

- `tests/helpers.mjs`: track every `makeTempDir()` workspace + broker session dir, sweep on process exit / SIGINT / SIGTERM / SIGHUP / SIGBREAK. Test orphan brokers under `/tmp/cxc-*` no longer accumulate to 100+ on dev machines (#163)
- `runTrackedJob`: install foreground SIGTERM / SIGINT / SIGHUP / SIGBREAK handlers around the runner. Killed jobs now reach a terminal `status:"failed" + phase:"terminated" + failureReason:"signal:<NAME>"` instead of an indefinite `status:"running"` zombie (#228)
- `codex.mjs`: bound the `finalizing` phase. A turn stuck after `exitedReviewMode` / `final_answer` for 5 min self-fails with a deterministic error message, releasing the state lock. Override via `CODEX_FINALIZING_PHASE_TIMEOUT_MS` (#183)
- `state.mjs` PID liveness reaper: `listJobs(cwd, { reap: true })` (now used by every read entrypoint + stop-review-gate) sweeps running / queued jobs whose pid is dead OR whose `processStartedAt` no longer matches the OS-reported birth time. `failureReason` = `reaper:process_died` / `reaper:pid_reused`. Resolves the shared root cause behind #222 / #164 / #202 / #264
- async + bounded hook stdin drain in `lib/fs.mjs` (`readStdinAsync` / `readHookStdinJsonAsync`). Both `session-lifecycle-hook` and `stop-review-gate-hook` migrate off the synchronous `fs.readFileSync(0)` that crashed with EAGAIN on parallel sessions and blocked the Stop hook for the full 900s timeout on Windows Git Bash (#120 / #247 / #191)
- broker idle watchdog tightened to 10 min grace + 2 min interval (env override `CODEX_BROKER_IDLE_GRACE_MS` / `CODEX_BROKER_IDLE_INTERVAL_MS`). Orphan brokers are reaped within ~12 min instead of ~35 min in the worst case (#193)
- `ensureBrokerSession` runs the entire read-decide-spawn-write critical section under `withBrokerLockAsync` (new mkdir-based `.broker.lock/` directory, parallel to the state lock). Closes the third race in #286 where two parallel `/codex:*` from the same cwd both spawned orphan brokers
- `codex-rescue` agent + `codex-cli-runtime` skill: never use `--background` / `run_in_background` inside a git worktree (cwd matches `.git/worktrees/*` or `*/.claude/worktrees/*`). Foreground keeps the Bash call alive so the host harness waits for the result instead of deleting the worktree mid-run (#198)

## 1.0.4

- `/codex:agent`: approval-aware control with `--approval` policy (`never` / `on-request` / `on-failure` / `untrusted`) and pending-approval surfacing in `/codex:status`
- `/codex:rescue` and `/codex:agent`: `--sandbox` override (`read-only` / `workspace-write` / `danger-full-access`) for explicit sandbox control
- Hardened approval controls: stricter approval state tracking and risk classification
- Windows companion runtime: hardened test suite for cross-platform consistency
- `/codex:rescue`: routes through the Agent tool to prevent Skill recursion
- Bash arg quoting fix for `cancel`, `result`, `status` commands
- README: corrected invalid `xhigh` reasoning effort
- `codex-rescue` agent: `model:` declared in frontmatter
- Companion: honors `--cwd` when reporting session runtime

## 1.0.3

- App-server auth status used for Codex readiness
- Graceful handling of older Codex CLI without `thread/name/set`
- App-server spawn inherits `process.env` when no explicit env is provided
- Windows: respects `SHELL` for Git Bash
- Working-tree review no longer crashes on untracked directories
- Implicit resume-last and default cancel selection scoped to the current Claude session

## 1.0.2

- CI: pull request workflow added (tests + build)
- Tests: portable across platforms, repo roots derived from test file locations
- Reduced background task timing flakiness in tests
- Windows ENOENT fix when spawning `codex app-server`

## 1.0.1

- Windows: `shell: true` on `spawnSync` so `.cmd` shims resolve

## 1.0.0

- Initial version of the Codex plugin for Claude Code
